# Site
My first website, its in Swedish. 
Copy the text in translate and review my work if you want, 
I learned all this by myself and with no other help than a bit of google searching.
Please tell me what you think!

The website is basically something i did just as an idea to have something to learn with.
Today 1/12/2017 or in America 12/1/2017, i've managed to make a site that is pretty decent and works almost flawlessly.
The website is based on an idea that my classmates can post homework or testpapers so we all can benefit.
I would love feedback or tips of any kind!
